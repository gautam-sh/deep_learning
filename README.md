### This repository contains various deep learning models.

1. [dynamic_system_LSTM]([url](https://github.com/gautam-sh/deep_learning/blob/main/dyanmic_system_LSTM.ipynb)): Uses LSTM to predict trajectory of a dynamically evolving system. It takes trajectory as inputs to generate the predicted future state.
